Pingvin Share is a selfhosted file sharing plattform made for the [Appwrite Hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-appwrite-hackathon-on-dev-1oc0).

## Setup

At the moment, the setup is a bit time-consuming. I will improve the setup in the future.

### 1. Appwrite

Pingvin Share uses Appwrite as backend. You have to install and setup Appwrite first

1.  [Install Appwrite](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation)
2.  Create an Account on your Appwrite instance
3.  Change the `_APP_STORAGE_LIMIT` variable in the `.env` file of Appwrite to your prefered max size limit per share

### 2. Setup script

To setup the backend structure of Pingvin Share you have to run the setup script.

1.  [Install Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2.  Clone the repository with `git clone https://github.com/stonith404/pingvin-share`
3.  Visit the repository directory with `cd pingvin-share`
4.  Run `npm run init:appwrite`

### 3. Frontend

To set up the frontend of Pingvin Share follow these steps.

1.  Go to your Appwrite console, visit "API Keys" and copy the "Functions API Key" secret to your clipboard.
2.  Rename the `.env.example` file to `.env`
3.  Paste the key in the `.env` file
4.  Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_HOST` in the `.env` file to the host where your Appwrite instance runs
5.  Change `NEXT_PUBLIC_MAX_FILE_SIZE` in the `.env` file to the max file size limit you want

Start the frontend:

With docker:

1. Run `docker-compose up -d --build`

Without docker:

1. Run `npm install`
2. Run `npm run build && npm run start`


## Known issues / Limitations
Pingvin Share is currently in beta and there are issues and limitations that should be fixed in the future.
- `DownloadAll` generates the zip file on the client side. This takes alot of time. Because of that I temporarily limited this function to maximal 150 MB.
- If a user knows the share id, he can list and download the files directly from the Appwrite API even if the share is secured by a password or a visitor limit.
